        embed: Optional[:class:`Embed`]

        embeds: Optional[List[:class:`Embed`]]

            If ``None`` or empty, all embeds will be removed.

        components: List[Union[:class:`~discord.ActionRow`, List[Union[:class:`~discord.Button`, :ref:`Select <select-like-objects>`]]]]

            A list containing previous attachments to keep as well as new files to upload.
            You can use ``keep_existing_attachments`` to auto-add the existing attachments to the list.
            If ``None`` or empty, all attachments will be removed.

            .. note::

                New files will always appear under existing ones.

        keep_existing_attachments: :class:`bool`

                Only needed when ``attachments`` are passed, otherwise will be ignored.

        suppress_embeds: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress embeds for the message. This removes
            all the embeds if set to ``True``. If set to ``False``
            this brings the embeds back if they were suppressed.
        delete_after: Optional[:class:`float`]
            If provided, the number of seconds to wait in the background
            before deleting the response we just edited. If the deletion fails,
            then it is silently ignored.
        allowed_mentions: Optional[:class:`~discord.AllowedMentions`]
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message. If this is

            The merging behaviour only overrides attributes that have been explicitly passed

            If no object is passed at all then the defaults given by :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`

        Responds to an interaction by sending a message.

        Parameters
        ------------
        content: :class:`str`
            The content of the message to send.
        tts: :class:`bool`
            Indicates if the message should be sent using text-to-speech.
        embed: :class:`~discord.Embed`
            The rich embed for the content.
        embeds: List[:class:`~discord.Embed`]
            A list containing up to 10 embeds.
            
            If passed, ``embed`` also counts towards the limit of 10.
        components: List[Union[:class:`~discord.ActionRow`, List[Union[:class:`~discord.Button`, :ref:`Select <select-like-objects>`]]]]
            A list of up to five :class:`~discord.ActionRow`s/:class:`list`s.
            Each containing up to five :class:`~discord.Button` or one :ref:`Select <select-like-objects>` like object.
        file: :class:`~discord.File`
            The file to upload.
        files: List[:class:`~discord.File`]
            A :class:`list` of files to upload. Must be a maximum of 10.
        suppress_embeds: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress embeds for the message.
        suppress_notifications: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress desktop- & push-notifications for the post starter-message.
        delete_after: :class:`float`
            If provided, the number of seconds to wait in the background
            before deleting the response we just sent. If the deletion fails,
            then it is silently ignored.
        allowed_mentions: :class:`~discord.AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message. If this is
            passed, then the object is merged with :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`.
            The merging behaviour only overrides attributes that have been explicitly passed
            to the object, otherwise it uses the attributes set in :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`.
            If no object is passed at all then the defaults given by :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`
            are used instead.
        hidden: Optional[:class:`bool`]
            If :obj:`True` the message will be only visible for the performer of the interaction (e.g. :attr:`.author`).
